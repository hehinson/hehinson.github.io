Dr. Hinson serves as the Associate Director of Clinical Research in the Neurosciences ICU at OHSU, a member of the AAN’s Science Committee, and serves on the editorial boards of the journals Neurology, Stroke, and Neurocritical Care. 

## Current Interests and Projects:

- **Computational Neurocritical Care** : She identifies her work as "Computational Neurology"; her research involves developing precision strategies for the treatment of acute brain injuries, such as traumatic brain injury (TBI), by applying integrative approaches that include high dimensional molecular and clinical data to infer predictive models of disease-related phenotypes. Her long-term career goal is to advance precision medical therapies in TBI, so that clinicians can provide the right therapy, to the right patient, at the right time. In 2013, she was awarded the Oregon Multidisciplinary Training Program for Emergency Medicine Clinical Research K12 grant for her projected entitled “Fever and Inflammation in Neurotrauma (FAINT)”. She earned an American Heart Association “Young Investigator” award for an abstract based on data from FAINT entitled Differences in Inflammatory Dysregulation in TBI versus Major Trauma. 

- **Leadership**: Dr. Hinson has also been active in leadership at a national level. In 2015, she was selected to participate in the American Academy of Neurology’s “Emerging Leaders Forum”. This program is designed specifically to identify, orient, and cultivate talented, highly motivated individuals into future Academy leaders. Stemming from this experience, she founded the American Academy of Neurology’s LGBTQI section in 2017. Dr. Hinson is also a member of the AAN’s Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion Joint Coordinating Council, and is one of two EDI Associate editors for Neurology.
